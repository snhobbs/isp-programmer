ISP Programmer for NXP Cortex-M Chips

Command-line tool for programming NXP microcontrollers via the UART ISP interface.

## Features
### Secure Write

To prevent bricking the chip during an interrupted write:

- The checksum in flash is first set to zero, forcing the chip to boot into ISP mode if power is lost.
- The image is then written from the topmost page down to the first page.
- The first sector (which contains the valid checksum) is written last.

This ensures that any failure during programming will leave the chip in ISP mode.

## Chip Families Supported:
+ LPC80x
    + LPC802
    + LPC804
+ LPC82x
    + LPC822
    + LPC824
+ LPC84x
    + LPC844
    + LPC845

### Untested, expected to work
+ LPC81x
    + LPC810
    + LPC811
    + LPC812
+ LPC83x
    + LPC832
    + LPC834
+ LPC86x
    + LPC865

Chips using UU-encoded protocols (e.g., LPC1700 family) are not supported.
Other NXP devices with 1â€¯kB sectors *may* work if added to the `lpctools_parts.def` file.

The configuration file is identical to that used by the [lpctools project](http://git.techno-innov.fr/?p=lpctools).

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install ispprogrammer
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/snhobbs/isp-programmer.git
cd isp-programmer
pip install .
```

> Default chip definitions are bundled. For custom chips, use the --config-file flag or copy your lpctools_parts.def to /etc/lpctools_parts.def.


## Usage
### Erase Entire Flash
```bash
ispprogrammer --device /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -crystal_frequency 12000 masserase
```

### Program Flash Image
```bash
ispprogrammer --device /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -crystal_frequency 12000 writeimage --imagein blinky804.hex
```

### Read Chip Info
```bash
ispprogrammer --device /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -crystal_frequency 12000 querychip
```
